## Hand gesture tracking system using ROI method and Adaptive Kalman Filter

MATLAB Implementation of:

[Hand gesture tracking system using Adaptive Kalman Filter](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221230574_Hand_gesture_tracking_system_using_Adaptive_Kalman_Filter)

[Fusion of Motion and Color Cue for Hand Detection and Tracking](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283319737_Fusion_of_Motion_and_Color_Cue_for_Hand_Detection_and_Tracking)

usage:
run `KALMANmethod.m` or `ROImethod.m`

Parameters that need to be tuned are the mean and standard deviation:
```
u_cb = 120.3846; 
u_cr = 150.7692;
sigma_cb = 37.136041;
sigma_cr = 13.80914;
```
